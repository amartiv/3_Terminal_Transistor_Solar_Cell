# 3_Terminal_Transistor_Solar_Cell
 Modeling of the 3 Terminal Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor Solar Cell

* This software aims to model analytically the “three terminal heterojunction bipolar transistor solar cell” under the low injection model. The theory of this cell can be found in:

- A. Martí and A. Luque, “Three-terminal heterojunction bipolar transistor solar cell for high-efficiency photovoltaic conversion,” Nat. Commun., vol. 6, pp. 6902–6902, Apr. 2015.

* The model is developed in Jupyter-Python and should be self-contained meaning that it should contain in itself all the information to understand this modelling

* The name of the file where the code is developed is " 3TSC_Model.ipynb" and should be updated using Git  (GitHub) versioning system

* For working with the code (editing, runing…) we recommend installing Jupyter and Python using “anaconda”

* The deliverable D4_7_Open_software.docx is a deliverable that has to be presented at the end of May for the European Project  GRECO that contains further details  as well as it collects our experiences in developing this software in an open and collaborative enviorment

* The documentation about the sources for material parameters is included in the document “References_for_material_parameters.odt” under the “Material_parameters” folder.
