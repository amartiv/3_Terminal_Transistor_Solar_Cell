Therefore, we can use the solution we obtained from the emitter and define the function jeC accordingly to calculate the current density due to the minority carriers excess in the collector. ** hemos substraido la coordenada WR de la base de la condicion de contorno. no se pasa como argumento para que no parezca que depende de esa variable.pasarla como variable?"
