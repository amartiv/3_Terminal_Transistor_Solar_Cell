    "We do not need to carry out the calculations since the differential equation ruling the minority carriers in the collector is the same one than in the emitter with the appriate change of parameters. Therefore, we can use the solution we obtained from the emitter and define the function jeC accordingly to calculate the current density due to the minority carriers excess in the collector. ** hemos substraido la coordenada WR de la base de la condicion de contorno. no se pasa como argumento para que no parezca que depende de esa variable.pasarla como variable?"
